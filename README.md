Hi Rene
This is my pet-project. I've sent it to you to demonstrate a bit more of my skills. 
This is an app for event managers. With this app they could read and write guestlist synchronized with Google Spreadsheets. 
I shared it via Google Drive, because I'll publish it on the App Store. Don't want to spread it around github.

Files that could be interesting for you:

— in "Application" folder
   1. SceneDelegate,

— In "Modules" folder
   2. AuthorisationModule
   3. EventListModule
   4. GuestListModule,
   5. AddModifyGuestModule,
   6. OneGuestModule,

— In "Services" folder
   7. FirebaseService
   8. FirebaseDatabaseService
   9. GoogleSpreadsheetService
   10. AlertsFactory

Application in current state already can (for user):
    1. To create, modify and delete events,
    2. To create, modify and delete guests inside the event,
    3. And synchronise this with the Google Spreadsheets.
From developer part it looks like:
   1. ability to read and write data in cloud database, 
   2. register user via Firebase (+Facebook and +Google)
   3. read and write information with Google Spreadsheets.
   4. shows everything at the users screen.

I still have a lot of thing to do. 
But I hope the project can present my code structuring skills and demonstrate my basic programming skills.

I attached video to the folder to free you from the building app on your computer.
Thank you for the reading. Enjoy :-)
