Hi Rene!

This is my pet project. I've send it to you to demonstrate a bit more of my skills.
This is an app for event managers, with this app they could read and write guestlist with app and Google Spreadsheets.
I shared via Google.Drive, because I'll publish it on the App Store. Don't want to spread it around github.

#Files that could be interesting to you:

— in "Application" folder
1. SceneDelegate,

— In "Modules" folder
2. AuthorisationModule
3. EventListModule
4. GuestListModule,

— In "Services" folder
5. FirebaseService
6. FirebaseDatabaseService
7. GoogleSpreadsheetService

Application in current state can manage user registration and login process that I'll use for my future features.
It already can:
1. write and read data in cloud database, 
2. register user via Firebase +Facebook and +Google
3. read and write information to Google Spreadsheets.
4. shows everything at the users screen.

I still have a lot of thing to do. But I hope the project can present my code structuring skills and demonstrate my basic programming skills.

I attached video to the folder to free you from the building app on your computer.
Thank you for the reading. Enjojy :-)
