This is a pet-project which is an event management app that allows event managers to read and write guest lists that are synchronized with Google Spreadsheets. 

The current state of the application allows users to create, modify, and delete events and guests within those events, and synchronize them with Google Spreadsheets. 
From a developer's perspective, the app allows for reading and writing data in a cloud database, registering users via Firebase (including Facebook and Google), and displaying everything on the user's screen. 
Although there is still much to be done, I hope that this project demonstrates my coding and programming skills.
